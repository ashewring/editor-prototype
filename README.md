Diagram editor prototype

Basic features to implement:
* shapes: named boxes and the lines to connect them
* each shape should have a UUID and be stored in a local database
* boxes should be listed in a "library"
* one tab per diagram, with a subset of library elements

Editor usability enhancements:
* snap to grid
* on dragging boxes, show centre alignment and edge alignment in relation to "neighbouring" boxes
* on moving or resizing boxes, auto-align lines vertically or horizontally
